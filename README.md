## Introduction

Welcome to the "Amazon Sales and Products Analysis" project! This project was completed as part of my coursework at PrepInsta, where I explored the vast dataset from Amazon and used Power BI to create an interactive and insightful dashboard.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to gain valuable insights into Amazon's sales trends and product performance. To achieve this, I utilized Power BI's capabilities to create a dynamic dashboard that offers a comprehensive view of the data.

## Key Features

1. **Sales Performance:** The dashboard dynamically calculates and presents sales figures per month and year. This feature allows users to make quick comparisons between different time periods, aiding in understanding the growth trajectory of Amazon's sales.

2. **Product Analysis:** Understanding which products are driving profitability is vital for sellers and stakeholders. The dashboard goes beyond simple product listings and identifies top-performing products based on monthly and yearly performance. This information can be invaluable for inventory management and marketing strategies.

3. **Returns Analysis:** Returns play a crucial role in e-commerce. The dashboard includes an in-depth returns analysis section, shedding light on return rates and reasons for returns. This information can help businesses optimize customer experience and minimize returns.

4. **Geographical Insights:** Amazon operates globally, and understanding the geographical distribution of sales is essential. The dashboard provides a detailed analysis of sales volumes across different countries, offering valuable market insights for expansion and targeted marketing.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the dataset into Power BI.
3. Open the Power BI file (Amazon_Sales_Analysis.pbix).
4. Explore the different sections of the dashboard using the user-friendly interface.
5. Interact with charts, graphs, and filters to gain valuable insights.
